    <h1>Tanjid Ahmed (xJupitar)</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio, showcasing my work in blockchain and cryptocurrency.</p>

    <div class="section about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Tanjid Ahmed</strong> — though most people in the crypto space know me as <strong>xJupitar</strong>. I’m based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and since graduating from the <strong>University of Dhaka</strong> in 2018, I’ve been all-in on blockchain and crypto.</p>
        <p>With 7+ years of experience, I’ve worked across some of the most exciting corners of Web3 — building communities, running validator nodes, and helping projects grow from the ground up. Right now, I’m the <strong>Community Manager at RetroBridge</strong>, and I also moderate for <strong>Citrea</strong>, <strong>Privasea</strong>, and <strong>AgntHub</strong>. In the past, I’ve worked with <strong>UnlockFi</strong> and <strong>NuLink</strong>, where I leveled up from moderator to manager and learned what it really takes to keep a community active and inspired.</p>
        <p>On the technical side, I’ve operated validator nodes for networks like <strong>Redbelly</strong> and <strong>Powerloom</strong>, and previously for <strong>Sui, Celestia, Taiko, Opside, Ironfish, Massa, Q Blockchain,</strong> and <strong>Shardeum</strong>. That mix of community + infra work has given me a pretty unique perspective on both people and protocols.</p>
        <p>I'm always excited to connect with fellow crypto enthusiasts and work on cool projects that are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with decentralized tech. Feel free to reach out through my socials if you want to chat about the future of this space!</p>
